# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
## Final Course Project
Basically, one has to create an R script able to do the following 5 steps: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## This repo contains, other than this README.md file, 2 other files:
1. run_analysis.R - R script that performs the 5 tasks described above. 
2. CodeBook.md - A document describing the variables, its context, the data and the transformations made to it.

## Some details about the R-script
- The script will automatically donwnload the files in the specified working directory and then it will unzip them.
- The different libraries needed are contained in the script.
